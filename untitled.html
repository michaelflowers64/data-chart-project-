    <h1> Migrant Shelter Costs Skyrocket Past $10 Million Per Day as Budget Outpaces New Arrivals </h1>
   
    <h3> Three years into the crisis, City Hall spending has increased 460% far exceeding the growth rate of the migrant population. </h3>

    <p> New York City is now spending more than $10 million every day to shelter asylum seekers in converted hotels—a figure that has grown nearly five times while the rate of new asylum seekers entering the system has plateaued, according to an analysis of OMB and DHS budget records.</p>

    <p>The chart below indexes both the daily cost to house the shelter population to their January 2022 levels. The data reveals a stark divergence: while the population (green line) has leveled off and in recent months has shown a slight decline, the daily cost to house them (red line) has exploded, creating a widening efficiency gap.</p>

    <iframe title="Placeholder Chart" aria-label="Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-placeholder" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NPhun/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe>

    <p>This spending disconnect has drawn sharp criticism from fiscal watchdogs. In a report released earlier this year, the NYC Independent Budget Office (IBO)warned that the city's budgeting was failing to match the reality on the ground.</p>

    <p>"The Administration increased its cost estimates even as the number of new arrivals declined," the IBO stated in its report, noting that the city failed to "update its budget for services with changing arrival trends."</p>

    <p>The gap suggests that the primary driver of the spending surge is no longer the sheer number of people, but the rising administrative fees and reliance on emergency hotel contracts, which often cost upwards of $380 per night per household.</p>

    <p>As the 2026 budget process begins, the data places pressure on the Adams administration to explain why "temporary" emergency costs have become a permanent, and increasingly expensive, fixture of the city's financial plan.</p>
